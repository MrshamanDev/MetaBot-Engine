# MetaBot Engine

MetaBot Engine is a powerful Python-based automation tool designed to simulate human-like browsing behavior. It allows users to run multiple browser tabs, interact with websites, and perform tasks such as simulating traffic from various sources (search engines, social media, referrals), managing proxies, and monitoring system performance.

This tool is ideal for web automation, traffic simulation, and system performance monitoring.

## Features

- **Human-like Behavior Simulation**: Simulates real user interactions with websites (clicking, scrolling, mouse movements).
- **Multi-Tab Support**: Allows running multiple browser tabs simultaneously for a more realistic browsing experience.
- **Traffic Source Simulation**: Simulates traffic from different sources like search engines, social media, or referrals.
- **Proxy Support**: Allows using proxies to mask real IP addresses and manage traffic.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks CPU, memory, and network usage in real-time during bot operation.
- **Customizable View Duration**: Set the minimum and maximum duration for which the bot stays on a website.
- **Logging & Console Output**: Keeps detailed logs of bot activities for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes for the user interface.
